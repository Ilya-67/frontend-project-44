<h2>Project "Brain games"</h2>
<p>The "Bryan Games" project was created as part of training in JS script programming after completing the first stage of Hexlet courses. The goal of the project is to test the student's ability to use simple JS tools for writing code, the student's understanding of the basics of code quality, its functionality and maintainability. As well as the student's ability to interact with the external environment of the GIT.
Within the framework of the project, five independent games were developed, based on the work of mathematical algorithms and having a common logical part placed in a separate index.js file.
The Bin directory contains executable files for running games. The crc/games directory contains game files, the part of the code that contains the logic of a particular game.
Below are descriptions of games and examples of their code execution.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Brain-even</h3>
        <p>In the game "Brain-even" you need to answer the question of an even number or not.
        If the answer is correct, the program will answer "Correct!", if the answer is "empty" or contains an error, then the program will give the correct answer, offer to play again and exit.In case of 3 correct answers, the program will congratulate the player and exit.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brain-calc</h3>
        <p>In the game "Brain-calculator" in response to the program's question, you need to calculate a mathematical expression.The algorithm of the program is similar to that described in the first game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brain-gcd</h3>
        <p>In the game "Brain-gcd" in response to the program's question, you need to calculate and write the number that is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers indicated by the program.The algorithm of the program is similar to that described in the first game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brain-prime</h3>
        <p>In the game "Brain-prime" you need to answer the question of an prime number or not.The algorithm of the program is similar to that described in the first game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brain-progression</h3>
        <p>In the game "Brain-progression" in response to the program's question, write the missing number in the progression.The algorithm of the program is similar to that described in the first game.</p>
